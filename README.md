## About

Throughout my professional career I had the opportunity to work in different roles, during one of these experiences I worked in the support of administrative services accompanying the replacement of an industrial maintenance management software, part of a business resource planning system (ERP). This experience was what motivated me to undertake the training in Systems Analysis and Development.
Currently, I mainly study back-end technologies such as Node.js, Nest.js framework, JavaScript and Typescript programming languages, Model-View-Controller(MVC) architectural pattern, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. I'm even starting to study front-end technologies like the Next.js framework, React.js library, HTML and CSS markup language.
As a professional in this area, I intend to contribute to the creation of technological solutions that add value to services and products, but mainly to develop solutions that are focused on people.
